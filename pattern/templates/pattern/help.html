<h2>Help!</h2>

<p>Welcome to patternlib! This is a website for exploring pattern made
in the <a href="http://tidalcycles.org">TidalCycles</a> language,
known as Tidal for short.
</p>

<p>Tidal is designed for making music from patterns, described with
code. You also see a lot of colour patterns - each one is a visual
representation of a pattern, to give an impression of the pattern's
structure.
</p>

<p>If you click on a pattern on the <a href="{% url 'index' %}">front
page</a>, you should be able to read the code that someone typed into
patternlib, hear the sound generated from it, and an see the visual
generated from the same code.
</p>

<p>You can browse other people's patterns, or log in (currently via
either Twitter or GitHub) to add your own patterns. If you want to add
your own, you'll need to know some TidalCycles code, you can find an
introduction and reference on
the <a href="http://tidalcycles.org/">Tidalcycles website</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="{% url 'pattern_add' %}">create a fresh pattern</a>, or take someone
else's pattern as a starting point, just click on one and then click
'make a new pattern from this one.'</p>
